                Certain sections of the Site may allow you to purchase many different types
                of products and services online that are provided by third parties. We are
                not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability or any
                other aspect of these products and services. If you make a purchase from a
                merchant on the Site or on a site linked to by the Site, the information
                obtained during your visit to that merchant’s online store or site, and the
                information that you give as part of the transaction, such as your credit
                card number and contact information, may be collected by both the merchant
                and us. A merchant may have privacy and data collection practices that are
                different from ours. We have no responsibility or liability for these
                independent policies. In addition, when you purchase products or services
                on or through the Site, you may be subject to additional terms and
                conditions that specifically apply to your purchase or use of such products
                or services. For more information regarding a merchant, its online store,
                its privacy policies, and/or any additional terms and conditions that may
                apply, visit that merchant’s website and click on its information links or
                contact the merchant directly. You release us and our affiliates from any
                damages that you incur, and agree not to assert any claims against us or
                them, arising from your purchase or use of any products or services made
                available by third parties through the Site.

                anticipating demand for a particular product or service. You agree to only
                purchase goods or services for yourself or for another person for whom you
                are legally permitted to do so. When making a purchase for a third party
                that requires you to submit the third party’s personal information to us or
                a merchant, you represent that you have obtained the express consent of

                The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse
                for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet
                infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good
                faith that materials hosted by QCA Marketing infringe your copyright, you,
                or your agent may send to QCA Marketing a notice requesting that the
                material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a
                copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to
                comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient
                notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon QCA Marketing actual
                knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts
                are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright
                infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to
                send to QCA Marketing a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices
